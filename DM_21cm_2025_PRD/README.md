# How to use these codes
This projects used several custom packages, all available on GitHub. These packages are under constant development, so please use correct commit versions if you want to reproduce my results.

1. Install our own custom version of 21cmFAST from GitHub:
    https://github.com/Junsong-Cang/21cmFAST/tree/DarkSide
    Commit: Tue Sep 23 10:46:38 2025 +0200 (9bfb0f5cfb258775b8816c7943bca672f09e8048)
    Note: Switch to the DarkSide branch after clone
2. Get the PyLab repo which contains some additional python libraries used for this paper, the repo can be used without installation:
    https://github.com/Junsong-Cang/PyLab
    Commit: Mon Sep 22 23:32:11 2025 +0200 (031b02d64cfaf82dedeb6a81c42a75061da53421)
3. Go to v3, which is the latest version (v1 is the version used for first arXiv submission)
4. Run GetLightcones.py
    What this code does:
        run and save lightcone and coeval boxes
        post-process coeval boxes to compute power spectrum
    You can run on HPC by GetLightcones.sh
5. Copy the lightcones and power spectrum files to an approriate location
6. Run main.ipynb
    This notebook makes the plots using the lightcones and power spectrum files generated by GetLightcones.py

Have fun!
